**Press any key to start the game. The game level is displayed, and a sequence of colors is generated. Click on the buttons in the correct order to repeat the sequence. Each button click triggers an animation and a sound effect. If the sequence is correct, the game level increases, and a new sequence is generated. If the sequence is incorrect, the game ends.**
